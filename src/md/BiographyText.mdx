    Hey! I'm Myna! I love code, music and physics.
    I'm a developer who writes in Typescript with React,Next and other frameworks.
    I am extremely thirsty for knowledge and I like to study from the most complex
    and well-formed things to the simplest and most objective.
    Currently I'm studying neuroscience and good coding practices
    (clean-code principles, tests, among other things that make our
    eyes shine just by looking at the code).
