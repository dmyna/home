    Hii! My name is Myna! I love code, music and science (mainly the study of the brain).

    I'm a developer who loves Rust code and breathes Linux.
    I also do things with Typescript, like this website.

    I have a great thirst for knowledge and I like to learn everything,
    from the most complex and well-formulated things to the simplest and most objective.

    Check out my full presentation to learn more about me! \<3
