Hi! This is the code for my website, here you can see my introduction, my main projects and other things about me, like my blog.

I used Typescript, NextJS, Prisma and other technologies to make it. The project is open source, which means I welcome contributions and constructive criticism about how good it is. Feel free to open an issue!

## Development
This code uses Docker to create an isolated development environment. Just use `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` and watch the magic happen!
